- add back `Cargo.lock`
- rewrite:
  - server-client: run in background, start with IPC message
    - will be much faster
    - no longer important to minimize binary size
  - scrap scripts: use rust libraries
    - you will find what you need to get time info, hardware and much more
    - binary will be larger, but this is now ok
    - no user wants to fix scripts
  - configuration: use files
    - easier to implement and maintain
